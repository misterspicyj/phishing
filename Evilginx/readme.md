# Evilginx Automated Setup Script

This Python script automates the process of downloading, extracting, and configuring Evilginx with a custom phishlet. It simplifies the setup for phishing campaigns by handling the technical details, allowing you to focus on crafting effective lures.

---

## Features

- **Automated Download**: Fetches the latest Evilginx release for Linux (64-bit).
- **Phishlet Generation**: Creates a customizable phishlet template for WordPress login pages.
- **Interactive Configuration**: Prompts for user input to configure Evilginx settings.
- **Lure Creation**: Generates a lure and provides the URL for immediate use.

## Configuration Prompts

Upon execution, the script will ask for the following inputs:

1. **Phishlet Name**: A unique identifier for your phishlet (e.g., `hackingwithj`).
2. **Phishlet Domain**: The domain associated with the phishlet (e.g., `hackingwithj.com`).
3. **Your Domain**: The domain you control for hosting the phishing page (e.g., `hackingwithj.cam`).
4. **External IP Address**: Your public IP address (e.g., `146.190.237.243`).

These inputs are used to configure Evilginx automatically.

## Phishlet Template

The included phishlet template is designed for **WordPress login pages**, targeting cookies like `wordpress_sec_.*` and `wordpress_logged_in_.*`. To adapt it for other login pages:

- Modify the `auth_tokens` keys.
- Adjust the `auth_urls` to match the target login page.
- Update the `credentials` extraction rules.
- Change the `login` domain and path accordingly.

This flexibility allows the phishlet to be customized for various platforms.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by the **Hands-On Phishing** course by Tyler Ramsbey on Simply Cyber Academy. The course provides practical training on setting up phishing campaigns using tools like GoPhish and Evilginx2.
